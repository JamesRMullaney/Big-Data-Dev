# Big-Data-Dev

## Current:

I'm a senior about to graduate with my Bachelor of Science in Data Science with an emphasis in Computer Science.

## Background:

I'm from St. Louis, Missouri. I received my associates in Computer Science from Mineral Area College. My hobbies include going to the gym and working on data visualizations about political and sports information.

## Plans:

My future career plans start with getting an entry level business, data or financial analyst position. I hope to take my experience learned in my first to gain a data visualization / data scientist position for a sports company.
